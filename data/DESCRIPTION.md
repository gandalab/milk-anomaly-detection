## Data Description

Golden datasets to use in analyses:

### Microbe Tables
1. **Raw read counts with contaminants removed:** `read_counts_decontaminated.txt`  
2. **RPM with contaminants removed, all samples, no RPM threshold** `milk_all_samples_decontam_RPM_DS10828562.txt`
3. **RPM with contaminants removed, supported only (RPM > 0.1)** `milk-real-samples-decontam-RPM-supported-microbes-only_from_DS10828562.txt`
4. **TOTAL QC'd read counts** for RPM normalization  (last column "Kraken.UNCLASSIFIED" has the count of quality filtered PhiX filtered read pairs): `Milk66samples_NewFiltering_ReadCounts_forRPM.csv`
