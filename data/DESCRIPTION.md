## Data Description

Golden datasets to use in analyses:

### Microbe Tables
1. **Raw read counts with contaminants removed:** `read_counts_decontaminated.txt`  
2. **QC'd (PhiX removed, post-trim and low quality removed) read counts for all samples for RPM normalization:** `read-counts-milk-samples-controls-incl-for-RPM.txt`  
3. **RPM with contaminants removed, all samples, no RPM threshold** `milk_all_samples_decontam_RPM_DS10828562.txt`
4. **RPM with contaminants removed, supported only (RPM > 0.1)** `milk-real-samples-decontam-RPM-supported-microbes-only_from_DS10828562.txt`
